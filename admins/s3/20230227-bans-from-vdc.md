# Incident/Action name

- Date and time of occurrence: Sunday, 02-26 ('Kero') and 02-27 ('Neptune')

- Description of the event: Kero and Neptune have both been banned from VDC for Community Disruption for accruing too many mutes

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened:
  - After recent mod actions taken against the players, Admins called a ban vote, both of which ended 5-1 in favor of a permanent ban.

- Impact of the event:
  - Encouraging a more welcoming environment by removing two players who have been repeated disruptors of the community by misleading new players, 
    often causing arguments in chats, making inappropriate racially/sexually charged comments, and more.

- Response and resolution:
  - Banned player 'Kero'
  - Banned player 'Neptune'
  - Admins will begin working with staff teams to find a reasonable line to start these ban discussions sooner in the future.

## Conclusion

- Admins acknowledge that it took too long to reach the point of a ban discussion, and will get rid of repeat offenders sooner in the future

- We are committed to ensuring VDC is a welcoming environment for everyone, and do not wish to encourage an environment in which troublemakers can misbehave freely
