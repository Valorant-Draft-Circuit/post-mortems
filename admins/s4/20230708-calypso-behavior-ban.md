# Ethan Behavior Ban

- Date and time of occurrence: 07-06-2023 0830 PST

- Description of the event: KC Elite player 'Calypso' (AKA Ethan AKA TwinkleToes) was banned by Admin vote due to repeated violation of community guidelines

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - After being presented with evidence that Ethan had sent NSFW pictures to a mod, in addition to repeated trolling behavior and bandwagon harassment in the VDC Discord, Ethan was banned from VDC for a minimum of 1 season, subject to appeal. His ban was voted on by the admin team but was carried out improperly through right click discord ban by the server owner. This shouldn't happen, as all bans should go through the Dyno bot so that the banned player has information about why they were banned and the path to appeal.
  
` `  
- Impact of the event: 
  - Removal of a player who has been repeatedly disruptive and trolling the community and staff.

` `
- Response and resolution: 
  - Banned player 'Calypso'
  - Issued yet another public statement about harassment of staff. Actually crazy that we have to keep saying this.
  - Discussed with server owner that all bans must go through Dyno for transparency.

## Conclusion

- Ethan/Calypso's behavior is a symptom of a larger problem in this discord. There is a continued spread of misinformation and toxic behavior from a vocal minority of players who don't like the staff teams, or the fact that their friends were held accountable for poor behavior. The behavior and discourse in this server is frankly unacceptable. It would get people barred from any in person organized league, so why is there a different standard here? Just because it's online is no excuse, there are real people reading the things you say and send. 
  
- This case also involved NSFW material. We **continue** to hold the stance that NSFW material is not allowed in VDC, there are minors in this server, and we are not going to allow that content. This is not a point that is up for discussion. If you think that something you want to post is borderline, *then don't send it.* It will continue to be punished.
