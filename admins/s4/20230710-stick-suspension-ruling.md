# stick Suspension Ruling

- Date and time of occurrence: 07-07-2023 1250 PST

- Description of the event: Former TT Elite player 'stick' was suspended from league play for the rest of the season and converted to RFA by admin vote

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - After being presented with evidence that 'stick' has been throwing matches while rostered on TT, while also communicating with KC players about joining their team, the admin team voted to suspend 'stick' for the remainder of the season, and convert him to RFA. 
  

- Impact of the event: 
  - This prevented KC from claiming 'stick' on waivers, and shrunk the already small elite FA pool. 

- Response and resolution: 
  - Suspended player 'stick' from further S4 matches, converted 'stick' to RFA
  - Informed KC they would not be able to pick up 'stick' on waiver.

## Conclusion

- There are ways to leave a team, and there are ways to acquire a player from another team. No one in this scenario went about it the right way. If a player wants to leave, they should discuss being cut or traded with their GM. If another team wants a player, they should ask their GM to make trade offers and negotiate at a franchise level.
  
- Throwing games ruins the experience for everyone else in the server. Match quality, competitive integrity, and player experience all suffer if someone decides to 'run it down' or intentionally throw rounds. This behavior is tantamount to throwing a temper tantrum, and will not be allowed in the league. 

## Appendix

- Relevant rules: 
  - 3.1.2	Players may not choose to leave a team while under contract, but may request to be cut or traded, subject to their GMâ€™s approval.
    - 3.1.2.1	If a player is cut for refusing to play for their team, they will be suspended for half of the number of total matches in the season (rounded up) or until the match day following roster lock if the season is more than halfway completed. They will become an RFA after this time.

- Evidence for this case includes:
  - Chat messages from 'stick' 
  - Testimony of teammates and opponents from matches.
  - Clips from match streams.
  - Messages from KC players and staff.
