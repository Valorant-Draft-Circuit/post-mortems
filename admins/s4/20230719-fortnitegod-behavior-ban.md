# fortnitegod Behavior Ban

- Date and time of occurrence: 07-17-2023 1300 PST

- Description of the event: Discord member fortnitegod was banned as a culmination of repeated behavior violations

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - fortnitegod repeatedly ignored verbal and bot warnings about spam and out of context chat in the discord server. They also made several inappropriate sexist remarks about women. The decision to ban this person was made when they violated discord TOS and server rules by going to another members DMs to threaten violence against themselves as a consequence of being warned again. This behavior is not acceptable as a casual threat or blackmail statement. 
  

- Impact of the event: 
  - Removal of a player who has been repeatedly obnoxious, disruptive, and combative to the community and staff, in addition to ignoring behavior warnings and repeatedly engaging in the same violations.


- Response and resolution: 
  - Banned user 'fortnitegod' AKA 'MINECRAFT!!!'
  - The user was sent contact information for crisis phone lines and text numbers in case they were serious about their self harm threats, but VDC discord is not the place to threaten people with "I'm going to kill myself unless..." As a rhetorical tactic this is reprehensible, and if the threats are genuine, then this space was not safe for them to partipate if it makes them suicidal.

## Conclusion

- 'fortnitegod' started off strong in chat, getting muted almost immediately for making sexist remarks and baiting the community. Frankly, this ban was a long time coming and should have happened after the initial sexism incident. Due to other business distracting the admin team, it was only issued as a mute. They came back up on our radar as a result of the threats they made in another user's DMs, and it was rectified.
