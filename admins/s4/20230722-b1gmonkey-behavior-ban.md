## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - 'B1GMONKEY' was muted several times for inciting drama, toxicity, and posting sexual content. They received numerous verbal warnings prior to both mutes and the ban. They have also received manual timeouts. The decision to ban this person was made when they ignored their verbal warning to stop trying to bait a minor into saying sexual things in the chat. There was a unanimous vote to ban 'B1GMONKEY', but processing the ban was delayed until after Elite finals to avoid further impacting KCs playoffs after the roster lock.

  - Banned user 'B1GMONKEY'

## Conclusion

- 'B1GMONKEY' has been a repeat offender, who was consistently involved in toxicity and drama in chat, posting sexual content, and generally being a bad faith participant in the community. This player was also consistently hostile to staff and responded to numerous warnings with a repeat of the same behavior they were warned about. NSFW content will not be tolerated, and ESPECIALLY not trying to engage with a child to post more NSFW content. This community should be a place where people have fun, engage in a league environment for a game they enjoy, and make friends. It should also be a place where people are safe. That means no NSFW content, there are minors here.
