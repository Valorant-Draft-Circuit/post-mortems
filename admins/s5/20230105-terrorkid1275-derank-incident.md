# Terrorkid1275 Deranking Incident
- Date and time of occurrence: 1-4-2024

- Description of the event: Admins have investigated multiple reports of Terrorkid1275#NA1 intentionally deranking his account.

## Summary
- Brief overview of what happened: 
    - On January 4, 2024, several reports were made to Admins alleging that Terrorkid1275#NA1 was intentionally deranking his main account by queuing with four other players on alt accounts and surrendering after the fourth round. An investigation into his career and his tracker.gg link showed that in the course of the night, Terrorkid had surrendered 16 games in a row and brought his rank down from Diamond 1 to Platinum 1. According to Riot news released by Valorant devs, "intentionally tanking an account's MMR by losing/forfeiting games" are "explicitly against our Terms of Service, and will result in a ban."

- Impact of the event: Intentionally tanking a main account results in improper MMR calculations for future seasons, and provides incorrect and inaccurate data to VDC numbers teams. Additionally, this action is directly against Riot ToS, VDC Rulebook, and the VDC Behavior Guidelines.

- Response and resolution:
    - Admins, in a unanimous vote, have decided to force convert Terrorkid1275 from a Free Agent to Restricted Free Agent for the remainder of the season. 

        - Admins, in a unanimous vote, have also decided to impose an MMR penalty of the greater of EITHER: Max Tier MMR; or Max Tier MMR*0.1.
    
        - Terrorkid's MMR is now 128. While this would normally place him within Expert Tier, he will remain in Apprentice.

## Conclusion
- Any future incidents of this nature will result in this same penalty.

- Any player choosing to impact their main account in this manner, either by smurfing or "reverse smurfing," will face the same or similar consequences.

## Appendix
- Relevant Rules:
    - 1.4.1: Smurfing may be defined as any of the following: Making an alternate account to play in VDC at a level of skill lower than the player could successfully play at; attempting to intentionally game our MMR systems to be placed lower; or not disclosing the highest ranked account a player has when signing up or after signing up, if the account is made after entering the league. ALL ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE REPORTED WHEN SIGNING UP FOR VDC.

    - 1.4.3 When a case of suspected smurfing is reported, the Admin team will investigate. Exact processes will not be disclosed as it may help a player guilty of smurfing protect themselves.

    - 1.4.4 Players who are found to be smurfing can face a variety of punishments, including but not limited to: Removal from VDC; being moved to an RFA at the correct MMR; having their MMR increased during a season; or temporary suspension.

    - Rule 27 of the Behavior Guidelines: Breaking Riot ToS (selling/purchasing accounts, cheating, boosting for hire, etc.)
