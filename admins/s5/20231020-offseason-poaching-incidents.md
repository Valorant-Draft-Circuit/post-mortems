# Poaching Incidents

- Date and time of occurrence: 10-16-2023 through 10-18-2023

- Description of the event: Admins have investigated multiple reports of poaching that took place on the 16th. The results of our investigation are as follows.

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - On the 16th of October, during the Open Discussion period, multiple reports came in regarding other franchises poaching players to join their team to become their AGM. Specifically, reports were made towards The Mafia's GM Ace and The Automata's GM GarrDeBoss regarding contact with players that violated poaching rules. Ace and GarrDeBoss were both found to have contacted Kryo, who is not only unable to be contacted without GM approval due to still being on contract with Solaris for one season, but also cannot be promised AGM without approval from his GM. Our findings revealed that, while Ace had permission from Solaris' GM, Tavasi, GarrDeBoss did not. Additionally, GarrDeBoss had contacted Kirbs, a player whose contract was expiring, and offered them an AGM slot during the Open Discussion period. While contacting them to express interest in signing them is allowed, promising them AGM during this time is not.

- Impact of the event: Poaching rules during Open Discussion have been made clearer, and those who broke poaching rules during this event have been given warnings and a slight punishment.

- Response and resolution:
    - GarrDeBoss has received a formal warning about their involvement in poaching.
    - Kryo will be banned from becoming an AGM for ATO until the end of Season 5.
    - All GMs will be issued a warning about poaching, and if it happens again during this season, harsher punishments will follow.
    - The rulebook has been modified to make it more clear that players cannot be promised AGM during the Open Discussion period. [Please check the changelog] to view specific rule changes.

## Conclusion

- The instances of poaching that took place are a combination of a certain rule being unclear, a player reaching out to GMs despite knowing poaching will take place if conversation ensues, and a newer GM not being fully aware of the rule updates. Admins will attempt to be more clear with newer GMs to make sure they avoid putting themselves in situations where they are poaching.
- Despite any uncertainties that may have caused these events, it is the responsibility of GMs to be aware of the rules in the rulebook and to avoid poaching.
- In the future, the admin team will contain these investigations in a more private area than the involved franchise's transaction channels.

## Appendix

- Relevant Rules:

  - 15.2.2.1 Discussions should not go further than an inquiry, any other discussion should be done through the franchise that currently has the player on contract. If the current franchise gives permission to continue discussions to both the player and inquiring GM, it will be allowed.
  - 15.2.2.2 If discussions go further, the management of the inquiring franchise may be barred from signing the player
    and/or face further punishment.
