# Rage on aimlabs ban evasion

- Date and time of occurrence: 11-02-2023 5:00 PM EST

- Description of the event: CrazyMonkey, a player who registered for the league in Season 5, was found to be evading a previous ban in VDC.

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened:
    - On the 2nd of October, it was found that CrazyMonkey had admitted to breaking the Riot Games Terms of Service by account sharing. After some additional investigating, it was found that this player had also evaded a VDC ban under a previous alias: rage. This player was originally banned in Season 2 for a litany of reasons, including repeatedly ignoring moderators, spamming, being incredibly rude to other players, posting NSFW, and much more. As a result, this player has been permabanned, and they will not be welcome back into the server under any circumstances. Even if this account did not belong to rage, their involvement in account sharing combined with their one year suspension from Valorant for toxicity would disqualify them from the league anyway.

- Impact of the event: A banned player was found within the community and swiftly removed.

- Response and resolution:
    - Rage's alternate discord account, CrazyMonkey, has been banned from VDC permanently.
    - Any attempt to return to VDC will result in future bans of rage's accounts, as he will never be welcomed back into the community ever again.
    - No further postmortems will be made relating to rage, unless a severe event calls for one otherwise, relating to ban evasion. One postmortem is enough attention for one person.

## Conclusion

- Please don't evade your punishment. :)
- Players who go to such lengths to troll do not deserve a place in the community.
- If rage contacts you involving appealing a ban, coming back to VDC, or really anything, we highly recommend ignoring and/or blocking them.

## Appendix

- Relevant Rules:
    - 1.4.6      Boosting or being boosted via the use of account sharing qualifies as smurfing, as it breaks the Terms of Service by Riot.
    - Rule 25:   Breaking Riot TOS
    - Rule 16:   Punishment evasion
