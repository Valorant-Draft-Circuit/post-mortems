# Smurfing Players

- Date  of occurrence: 
    - First report: April 6, 2024
    - Second report: May 10, 2024

- Description of the event: NotKenny#hers and PreppyPenguin99#ezzz (formerly Clipz#ezzz) are playing on smurf accounts in VDC. Multiple players were aware of these players playing on smurf accounts. 

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened:
    - After a thorough investigation following a report that these two players were smurfing, we found credible evidence of smurfing. In addition to the evidence, we found multiple people implicated in this situation. 

## NotKenny13#hers
- On April 1, 2024, NotKenny was informed that he was not allowed to play on alt accounts. On April 12, 2024, he was told to list all accounts he had. He stated he "listed everything that [he] had." 
- On May 12, 2024, Admins investigated and found indisputable evidence of six total alt accounts that he did not report. Several of those accounts peaked Ascendant 2. If those alt accounts had been reported, his MMR would have been much higher than his current MMR of 135. He was told multiple times to report all of his alt accounts. Additionally, according to the rulebook, "players who know a teammate or other member of the league have not disclosed an account, but do not inform VDC Admins, may face punishment." NotKenny13 was aware that his teammate and friend, Clipz#ezzz (PreppyPenguin99#ezzz - for simplicity, Clipz from now on), was not playing on his main account. This player is currently rostered by Party Animals' Expert team. 

- Impact of the event: Incorrect MMR assessment, compromised competitive integrity within the league, smurfing in the incorrect tier.  

- Response and resolution:
    - This player is no longer welcome in this league and is subsequently permanently banned from VDC due to his dishonesty and attempt to smurf in the league. The GM of this player, according to the rulebook, has until Wed, 5/22/24, at 8:00 pm EST to replace this player on the roster. Until the player is replaced, the team will be allowed to use a substitute player in place of this player during matches. Any substitutes who sub for the smurfing player do not count towards the 2 substitute maximum. 

## Clipz#ezzz
- On May 12, 2024, Admins investigated and found indisputable evidence of this player smurfing. The actual main account, which was not reported at any time, is sbb#flex. This player is a Tier 3 player who peaked Immortal 2 and is currently rostered on a Tier 3 team. If his main account had been reported, his MMR would have been much higher than his current MMR of 135. Additionally, according to the rulebook, "players who know a teammate or other member of the league have not disclosed an account, but do not inform VDC Admins, may face punishment." Clipz was aware that his teammate and friend, NotKenny, was not playing on his main account. This player is currently rostered by Party Animals' Expert team. 

- Impact of the event: Incorrect MMR assessment, compromised competitive integrity within the league, smurfing in the incorrect tier.

- Response and resolution: 
    - This player is placed on forced RFA status and his MMR corrected to 200. The GM of this player, according to the rulebook, has until Wed, 5/22/24, at 8:00 pm EST to replace this player on the roster. Until the player is replaced, the team will be allowed to use a substitute player in place of this player during matches. Any substitutes who sub for the smurfing player do not count towards the 2 substitute maximum. 

## bon appetit 2#1234
- This player did not report an alt account and was also reported for playing on this alt account during a VDC scrim. This player was aware of both Clipz and Masta not playing on their main accounts in VDC. bon appetit 2#1234 is currently rostered by Mafia's apprentice team. 

- Impact of the event: Incorrect MMR assessment, failed to report an alt account, compromised competitive integrity within the league by failing to report a player for smurfing. 

- Response and resolution: 
    - This player is placed on forced RFA status for the remainder of the season. 

## Other players who were implicated in this situation
- Admins found credible evidence that the other following players were aware that Clipz was not playing on his main account, and that NotKenny13/Masta had multiple alt accounts: 
  - Redek#Pro
  - pandiu#002
  - tort#6996
  - Zayn#784
- Admins found that Redek#Pro also had multiple confirmed accounts that did not show his true rank. This player was previously suspended and not allowed to play in the league for a different account that he did not report. No action will be taken other than he continues to be suspended indefinitely. 
- pandiu#002 and zayn#784 are currently Free Agents. These players will be placed on forced RFA status. 
- tort#6996 is a Restricted Free Agent. This player was given a formal warning and no other action will be taken other than they will continue to be on RFA status. 
    
 ## Conclusion

- Smurfing degrades and compromises the competitive integrity of the league. It is also against Riot Terms of Service and is against the rulebook. No player may claim ignorance of the rulebook or of the Riot TOS as a defense. All players must report all alt accounts they own and be truthful with information given to the league so as to be assessed an accurate MMR. Inaccurate MMR and dishonesty causes not just issues with games, but also may discredit match wins of the teams and franchises who rostered or subbed them in for games. It also disadvantages teams who might otherwise have used their time, energy, and efforts to find a different player than the smurf they inadvertently drafted or signed.
