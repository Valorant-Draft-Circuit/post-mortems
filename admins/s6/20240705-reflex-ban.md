# Reflex Permanent Ban

- Date  of occurrence: 
    - First report: May 4th, 2024 
    - Multiple reports following on May 20th, 2024, and another on May 24th, 2024, as well as report of sexual harasment on June 11th, 2024, and reported for doxxing, NSFW references, and pedophilia jokes on July 4th, 2024

- Description of the event: Reflex has been warned multiple times and punished for breaking VDC behavior guidelines. Despite his multiple warnings and mutes, he has continued to constantly break rules. 

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
    - Reflex has been a consistent problem since the beginning of this season. He has been muted and warned mutltiple times about harassment as well as been reported for sexually harassing a female member of VDC, including asking for this player's real-life social accounts. He also doxxed another VDC member in the VDC server. 

Reflex was first warned on on May 4th, 2024 for Rule 6, "Mild Toxicity." In this offense, he attempted to bait an individual into responding in a chat they did not have access to, and called them a "bitch."

Reflex was then given a mute on May 20th, 2024, for aggressive behavior towards another VDC member in mythic chat following a match. 

On May 24, 2024, Reflex was then muted for harassing a player by asking them for their Instagram account. This player was extremely uncomfortable with the fact that he used another underage player in VDC to bait them into giving him his Instagram. 

On May 26, 2024, Reflex attempted to retaliate against people who reported him for behavioral infractions by harassing players in their DMs. 

On July 2, 2024, Reflex began an extremely uncomfortable, inappropriate conversation with a minor in Mythic chat. This conversation joked about pedophilia. His side of the conversation included verbatim statements such as: 
- "*thinks to himself that she's so hot*;
- "So where do u live We should link up;"
- "It's okay hottie I can make u feel safe . . . In my arms"
- Asking a member "do u have big kahoonas"
- "R u hard" "Mmmmmm I'm holding mine too"
Sending and immediately deleting messages such as:
- "And ur caught im underage"
- "U good little e kitten"
- "I'm thinking of you and ur c**k" (original message censored)
During this incident, Reflex also doxxed a player by leaking where they went to school; their face; and called them a pedophile. 

- Impact of the event: This player is no longer welcome in this league and is subsequently permanently banned from VDC due to his harassment of members. 

- Response and resolution:
    - Reflex has been banned from VDC permanently as we take harassment and doxxing of members extremely seriously. 
    
 ## Conclusion

- Constant Harassment and doxxing is unacceptable in this league. VDC strives to be a place people can come and play valorant without being put down or harassed. 

## Appendix

    - Rule 6: Mild Toxicity 
    - Rule 11: Harassment (multiple instances)
    - Rule 22: Doxxing
