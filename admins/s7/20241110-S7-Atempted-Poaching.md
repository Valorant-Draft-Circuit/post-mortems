# S7 Atempted Poaching

Date and Time of Occurrence: 11-07-2024 7:30PMEST

Admins have investigated reports of poaching that have taken place from August 2024-November 2024. 

## Summary: 
On the 14th of November admins received reports that Kenny, who is still under contract to Project Nova, had sent a copy and paste message to his GM wishing to be cut. The message in question still had "hi (to whoever you message)". Further evidence was brought to the admins.  Below is a list of the people involved and the proven actions that were taken in this discussion. 

### Muppet
Evidence that shared examples of how to send a cut message to their GM, with the full copy and paste options.

### Gumba
Evidence that Gumba was aware of the poaching through Vin and Muppet joking about leaving their franchises and going to OS. Further evidence that he turned them down, but continued to be in the conversation as the cut messages to PA and PN were drafted.

### Kenny
Evidence of saying I will fake an injury but then magically heal when KC needs me
Asking for how to message his GM to be cut, using a copy and paste message without editing it.

### Vin: 
Discussion on how to get Kenny into KC, discussing trading and having him walk to then join KC
Showing potential meme cut messages to have Kenny and Muppet choose from in order to get them to walk away from their franchises

### Stick
Had a presence in the conversation and made comments that showed he was aware of the poaching taking place.


## Conclusion
Under Section 15 of the rulebook (see specific rules below), this classifies as poaching. Each of these players have been in VDC for several seasons and are aware of the rules revolving around poaching as this is not their first offence. The following consequences have been enforced:

- Vin and Kenny, due to their extensive behavior history in addition to their direct involvement with this offense, will be banned for 4 seasons without the possibility of appeal. Repeated behavioral offenses will result in stricter standards and compounding punishments.

- Gumba will be staff banned and will no longer be allowed to AGM. Additionally, Gumba will be forced to RFA in the next season that they are a player in. As a staff member you are held to a higher standard. As an AGM and former admin, being aware and not reporting is also considered poaching.

- Muppet will be staff banned and will no longer be a moderator of VDC effective immediately. As a moderator for Season 6 and this season up until this point, Muppet is aware of the behavior guidelines and the rulebook and is held to a higher standard.

- Stick will be staff banned and lose his position as Events Staff Lead for their past offense of poaching and involvement/knowledge of this case. As a team lead for VDC, having an awareness of poaching and choosing to be silent does not set the standard VDC needs in a staff team lead.

VDC takes poaching seriously as we value the competitive integrity of our league. Please ensure if you are reaching out to players to discuss playing with them, that you do so through the proper channels. It is essential that a player has typed and screenshotted evidence of their GM allowing them to engage in potential trade talks and/or roster building that includes said rostered player.

Appendix
Relevant Rules:
- 15.2.1 Franchises will be allowed to contact any player whose contract is expiring, to express interest in them, should they choose not to renew their contract with their current franchise.

- 15.2.2.2 If discussions go further, the management of the inquiring franchise may be barred from signing the player and/or face further punishment.
