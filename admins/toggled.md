# Toggled Vanguard Ban

- Date and time of occurrence: 02-24-2023 1830 PST

- Description of the event: LG player 'toggled' was Vanguard banned during map 1 of Friday's match - LG vs TT

## Summary

- Brief overview of what happened: 
  - During Map 1 of the LG vs TT Premier match last night, the LG player "toggled" received a permanent ban from Vanguard for cheating.
    The player left VC after saying that he was cheating in Warzone earlier, forgot to restart his pc, and those cheats were likely what triggered Vanguard.

- Impact of the event: 
  - This left LG down a player for the match night, as well as prevents 'toggled' from returning to VDC without a successful appeal to Riot. 

- Response and resolution: 
  - Admins discussed how to handle a mid match cheating ban, as this is the first occurrence in VDC. 
    As the teams involved were waiting in lobby for a resolution, and many admins were playing their own matches, this was a quick discussion and ruling.

## Conclusion

- LG forfeited Map 1, which was ended early due to Vanguard triggering. They were allowed to get an emergency substitute for Map 2.

- Toggled has appealed his ban to Riot. 
  Even if he was truthful about why he thinks he was banned, his appeal is likely to be unsuccessful due to Riot's TOS allowing them to ban players for running *any* cheat software even if it is not attached to the Valorant process.
  He will not be allowed to play in VDC while his appeal is pending, and will be banned from the league for use of cheats in VDC matches if his appeal fails. This ban would never be
  eligible for an appeal
  
- No matches will be retroactively forfeited unless a team can provide evidence that shows, beyond a reasonable doubt, that 'toggled' was
  cheating in their match. We feel that while it isn't fair to teams 'toggled' may have cheated against, it is also unfair if we assume he
  didn't download cheats yesterday for the first time, forcing LG to 0-18

## Appendix

- Relevant rules: 
  - 1.4 Banned Accounts
    - 1.4.1 - Players with an active HWID ban for Valorant will not be eligible to play in VDC for the duration of that ban. 
              A player with a permanently banned account may play in VDC if their HWID ban has expired. 
              This is in accordance with Riotâ€™s own rules, allowing players to return to the game on a new account once their HWID ban has ended.


- Notes: This is not the first Vanguard ban in the league. During s2 player 'shernikaur' was Vanguard banned during a scrim, and successfully appealed to Riot to reverse the ban.
  With this in mind, we are not going to allow people to dogpile blame or insults on to 'toggled' or LG, his punishment is being banned from the game and the league unless and until such time as he successfully appeals his Vanguard ban.
